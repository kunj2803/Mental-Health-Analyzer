# ðŸ§  Mental-Health-Analyzer

**Description:**  
Classifies mental health status from text (sentence) using a BERT-based NLP model. Supports both single text input and batch CSV predictions with probability visualization. The model is trained on mental health-related text datasets and predicts categories like Anxiety, Depression, Stress, etc.

**Dataset Details:**  
- **Source:** Public mental health datasets from social media posts, forums, or research datasets.  
- **Number of samples:** ~50,000+ 
- **Classes:**  
   - Normal
   - Depression
   - Suicidal
   - Anxiety
   - Stress
   - Bi-Polar
   - Personality Disorder
- **Download dataset:** [[Link to dataset]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health)  

**Features:**  
1. **Single text input** â€“ Enter a sentence and get the predicted mental health status with probabilities.  
2. **Batch CSV predictions** â€“ Upload a CSV file with multiple sentences to get predictions for each row, including probability visualization.

**Usage:**  
1. **Download the model Weights(417 mb) from my drive:**
```bash
python download_model.py
```

2. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
```
streamlit run app.py
```


**Notes:**
- Ensure you have installed the required packages from requirements.txt.
- The model will be saved to the specified path in download_model.py and used by the app for inference.

## Limitations of the Model

### 1. Domain-Specific Data (small scope)
- The model is trained on specific mental health datasets, such as [Kaggleâ€™s Mental Health Sentiment dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health).  
- Performance may degrade on text from other domains, languages, or platforms not seen during training.

### 2. Limited Class Coverage
- Currently predicts only the predefined classes: Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, Normal, Personality Disorder, Stress, Suicidal.  
- Does not account for other mental health conditions or nuanced emotional states.

### 3. Ambiguous or Sarcastic Text
- The model detects sarcasm at some extent but may fail to correctly classify sarcasm, humor, or ambiguous statements.

### 4. Language Limitation
- Trained primarily on English text; performance on other languages or heavily informal/slang text may be poor.

## Most Imp : 
    it need 2-3 line sentence to understand context better.
### Example : 
- "i am giving up."
     ```may predict normal```
- "Iâ€™ve tried everything I could think of, but nothing works. Honestly, I feel like Iâ€™m giving up on everything."
    - ```understands NLP and predict Depression/sucidal```
